    <div>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>⅔ cup mild chile peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups green bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the garlic, caraway seeds, and pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle or against the side of a mixing
                bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chile peppers; cook and
                stir until the peppers have softened, about 5 minutes. Remove them from the skillet and set aside. Add
                another tablespoon of oil to the skillet and cook the bell peppers and tomatoes until the peppers are
                soft and the tomatoes have begun to break down, about 5 more minutes. Add the tomato-bell pepper mixture
                to the hot peppers. Stir in the mashed garlic and caraway seeds. Spoon the vegetables onto plates or a
                serving platter.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Fry the eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are the
                desired consistency, about 2 to 3 minutes for runny yolks, 4 to 5 minutes for fully set yolks. Place the
                fried eggs on the vegetable mixture and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
